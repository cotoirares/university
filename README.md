## About

This repository showcases my progress and learning journey through the **first year** of the Computer Science program at Babes-Bolyai University.

## Semester 1

### 🚀 Fundamentals of Programming
- **Language Used**: Python
- **Description**: Assignments focusing on basic programming concepts, control structures, functions, and problem-solving techniques. Some of the final assignments are also designed to exercise Layered Architecture.

## Semester 2

### 🔗 Graph Algorithms
- **Language Used**: Python
- **Description**: Implementation of fundamental graph algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, and cycle detection. Emphasizes efficient data structures and understanding graph theory.

### 💡 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Language Used**: C++
- **Description**: Projects demonstrating OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Includes small applications with a GUI designed in Qt and games using classes and design patterns.

### 🛠️ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
- **Language Used**: C++
- **Description**: Implementation of essential data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, along with various searching and sorting algorithms. The focus is on time and space complexity optimization.

### 🖥️ Operating Systems
- **Language Used**: C, Shell Scripting
- **Description**: Assignments covering OS concepts like processes, memory management, and multithreading. Projects include creating simple command-line interpreters and implementing scheduling algorithms.
